      <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the way we live, work, and interact. 
        From our personal lifestyles through our social engagements to the way we conduct 
        our private and corporate businesses, AI is altering our methodologies and changing
         the landscape of end products. From the age-old medical expert systems and intelligent search
          engines to intelligent chatbots and predictive models, the enthusiasm for AI practice is growing
           rapidly. This article starts with a brief overview of AI, the key elements, and its recent 
           advancements. It concludes with a few suggestions for getting started. This will help enthusiastic
            readers take strategic steps toward getting involved in the process and contributing 
        to the digital transformation efforts in the oil and gas industry.

        Natural Language Processing

NLP is a branch of AI that allows machines to use and understand human language.
 It is built into products such as automatic language translators used in multilingual 
 conferences, text-to-speech translation, speech-to-text translation, and knowledge extraction
  from text. This technology is used to scan data in the form of raw language such as handwriting,
   voice, and images into contextually relevant structures and relationships that can easily be 
   integrated with other structured data for more efficient analysis in subsequent processes. Unstructured 
   data are rarely used since they were originally meant only for use by humans. Hence, there is a need to
    utilize, understand, and unlock the vast wealth of valuable information hidden in them.

      <h5>Expert Systems</h5>
     <p>
      Expert systems are machines or software applications that provide explanation and advice to users
       through a set of rules provided by an expert. The rules are programmed into software to reproduce 
       the knowledge for nonexperts to solve a range of actual problems. Examples of this are found in the 
       fields of medicine, pharmacy, law, food science, and engineering, and maintenance. In the oil and gas 
       industry, expert systems have been used from exploration through production, from research through operations,
       and from training through fault diagnosis..</p>

       <h5>Intelligent Agents</h5>
      <p>
        Multi-agent systems (MAS) is a subfield of AI that builds computational systems capable of making 
        decisions and take actions autonomously. These systems are capable of maintaining information about
         their environment and making decisions based on their perception about the state of the environment,
          their past experiences, and their objectives. Agents can also interface with other agents to 
          collaborate on common goals. They emulate human social behavior by sharing partial views of a
           problem, enabling collaboration, and cooperating with other agents to make appropriate and timely
            decisions to reach desired objectives. Agents have been implemented successfully, mostly in the 
            manufacturing industries, 
        and are proven to have potential benefits in the petroleum industry

      <h5>Computational Intelligence</h5>
   <p>Computational Intelligence is the computational aspect of AI that focuses on utilizing and deriving 
    value from data. It uses the knowledge-discovery and data-mining processes to develop ML workflows to 
    learn from historical data and predict future events. There are several algorithms designed to build ML
     models. Examples are artificial neural networks, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines,
      extreme learning machines, fuzzy logic types I and II, adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems
       (popularly known as ANFIS), Gaussian-process regression, Bayesian belief network, and K-nearest
        neighbor. Data science can be defined as the new and continuously evolving field that uses various 
        scientific methods, processes, algorithms,
     and systems to extract knowledge, patterns, or insights from data.</p>
