      <p>When put as simply as possible, data analytics is the process of looking at raw data,
        figuring out what it means, and then applying that knowledge to solve problems. It’s kind of
        a subsection of the larger data science field, and truly one of the more ubiquitous ones.
        Because everyone with a website deals with raw data in some way.
        Data analytics comes in because all of this is raw information that you see and can read.
        But the interpretation is what matters. Knowing that you have had a 37.2% increase
        in clicks over the past month is great. But…what do you do with that?

        Descriptive analytics This is what would be used above when talking about website stats.
        Descriptive analytics covers what happens over time. Things increasing or decreasing — time spent
        on the platform, clicks, which platforms refer to your site the most often, etc. You may not get the
        reasoning behind why the user
        is acting a certain way, but you can pinpoint exactly what they’re doing

      <h5> Diagnostic analysis</h5>
      <p>When you’re looking for the reason why something is happening, you’re using diagnostic analytics.
        If your website stats are booming and you want to know why (so that you can keep doing it), you will
        be looking at all the information from the website. You know clicks are up. But what particular articles
        are being seen? Are there times of day that get more traffic? You will dig in and determine the
        demographics of the visitors and whether or not any email campaigns have been sent that correlate to
        the spike. By taking a holistic look at the data, you can determine within a reasonable margin of
        error, the most likely factors that caused the data to look the way it does. And by diagnosing why
        it happened, you can then attempt to replicate it.
        (Or, if something has gone wrong, avoid making those same choices.)

      <h5>Prescriptive analysis</h5>
      <p>
        Prescriptive analytics is when you’re taking a look at the data and determining a reaction to it.
        Such as, if the number of clicks on Nintendo Switch articles increases another 25% for the next few
        months, you would then plan to up the output of articles on that topic and maybe even begin the process
        of hiring more writers to cover the increase. You are making plans based entirely
        on data you have and know has lasted over a period of time.</p>

    <div class="NTIdes">
      <h5>Predictive analysis</h5>
      <p>
        Now this on the other hand, is the practice of looking at a set of past data and making an
        assumptive plan based off it. This differs from prescriptive because there’s no way to know if
        your plan is 100% going to work out. For example, if you had 70% of all citizens indicate on a
        survey that they want a farmer’s market in your town and you make a plan to open up a weekly
        market…that’s making a predictive plan based on data. You are making an educated guess based on data,
        predicting the city’s residents will respond positively to your business,
        but you have no farmer’s market data of your own to go on.

      <h5>Wrapping Up</h5>
      <p>No matter where you are with data analytics, a beginner or a seasoned veteran,
        it’s a good idea to go over the basics. Because if you’re just looking at data, you’re not taking action.
        You just have data. It’s how you look at that data and move forward with it that matters. Whether you
        diagnose a problem or predict a response to your users, making the best
        decisions you can begins and ends with data analytics..</p>
