      <p>DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases
        an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and
        improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and
        infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to
        better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.

        How DevOps Works
        Under a DevOps model, development and operations teams are no longer “siloed.” Sometimes, these two teams
        are merged into a single team where the engineers work across the entire application lifecycle,
        from development and test to deployment to operations,
        and develop a range of skills not limited to a single function.
        In some DevOps models, quality assurance and security teams may also become more tightly integrated with
        development and operations and throughout the application lifecycle. When security is the focus of everyone
        on a DevOps team, this is sometimes referred to as DevSecOps.
        These teams use practices to automate processes that historically have been manual and slow.
        They use a technology stack and tooling which help them operate and evolve applications quickly and reliably.
        These tools also help engineers independently accomplish tasks (for example, deploying code or provisioning
        infrastructure) that normally
        would have required help from other teams, and this further increases a team’s velocity.

      <h5> Benefits of DevOps</h5>
      <p>Speed Move at high velocity so you can innovate for customers faster, adapt to changing
        markets better, and grow more efficient at driving business results. The DevOps model enables
        your developers and operations teams to achieve these results. For example, microservices and continuous
        delivery let teams take ownership of services and then release updates to them quicker.
        Rapid Delivery Increase the frequency and pace of releases so you can innovate and improve your product faster.
        The quicker you can release new features and fix bugs, the faster you can respond to your customers’ needs
        and build competitive advantage. Continuous integration and continuous
        delivery are practices that automate the software release process, from build to deploy.

      <h5>Why DevOps Matters</h5>
      <p>
        Software and the Internet have transformed the world and its industries, from shopping to entertainment
        to banking. Software no longer merely supports a business; rather it becomes an integral component of
        every part of a business. Companies interact with their customers through software delivered as online
        services or applications and on all sorts of devices. They also use software to increase operational
        efficiencies by transforming every part of the value chain, such as logistics, communications, and
        operations. In a similar way that physical goods companies transformed how they design, build, and
        deliver products using industrial automation throughout the 20th century,
        companies in today’s world must transform how they build and deliver software.</p>

      <h5>Intelligent Agents</h5>
      <p>
        Transitioning to DevOps requires a change in culture and mindset. At its simplest,
        DevOps is about removing the barriers between two traditionally siloed teams, development and
        operations. In some organizations, there may not even be separate development and operations teams;
        engineers may do both. With DevOps, the two teams work together to optimize both the productivity of
        developers and the reliability of operations. They strive to communicate frequently, increase efficiencies,
        and improve the quality of services they provide to customers. They take full ownership for their
        services, often beyond where their stated roles or titles have traditionally been scoped by thinking
        about the end customer’s needs and how they can contribute to solving those needs. Quality assurance
        and security teams may also become tightly integrated with these teams. Organizations using a DevOps
        model, regardless of their organizational structure,
        have teams that view the entire development and infrastructure lifecycle as part of their responsibilities.

      <h5>DevOps Practices Explained</h5>
      <p>There are a few key practices that help organizations innovate faster through automating and
        streamlining the software development and infrastructure management processes. Most of these practices
        are accomplished with proper tooling.

        One fundamental practice is to perform very frequent but small updates. This is how organizations
        innovate faster for their customers. These updates are usually more incremental in nature than the
        occasional updates performed under traditional release practices. Frequent but small updates make each
        deployment less risky. They help teams address bugs faster because teams can identify the last deployment
        that caused the error. Although the cadence and size of updates will vary, organizations using a DevOps
        model deploy
        updates much more often than organizations using traditional software development practices.</p>
