        Full stack development refers to the end-to-end application software development,
        including the front end and back end. The front end consists of the user interface,
        and the back end takes care of the business logic and application workflows.
        Consider a retail website. Users can browse or purchase specific items, delete or add items in cart,
        change their profile, and do many other things. All these actions require a front-end user interface (UI),
        as well as some business logic, written in the back-end.

      <p>
        What is a full stack developer and what do they do?
        Full stack developers must have knowledge of an entire technology stack, i.e., the set of technologies that are
        used to build an end-to-end application quickly and efficiently. For example, if they want to build an
        application using the MEAN stack, they should know how to work with MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node.
        Full stack developers should be able to judge whether the selected technologies are the right choice for their
        project during the early phases. Some responsibilities of a full stack developer are to:
        Help in choosing the right technologies for the project development and testing both on the front end and the
        back end.
        Write clean code across the stack by following the best practices of the tools used.
        Be up to date with the latest technologies and tools to make the best technology usage decisions.

      <h5>What languages do full stack developers use?</h5>
      <p>
        Full stack developers are free to use any set of languages that are compatible with each other and the overall
        application framework. JavaScript is a popular language often used by full-stack developers as it’s one of the
        very few languages that can be used both on the front end and back end. Companies will most likely hire a full
        stack developer for smaller or medium-size projects. Some popular languages are:

        Front end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
        Back end: Python, Java, R, Ruby, Node.js, PHP.
        It’s also a popular and convenient practice to use full technology stacks like MEAN stack, MERN stack, Ruby on
        Rails,
        and LAMP for faster and more efficient development, and an easier learning curve

    <div class="NTIdes">
      <h5>Front end vs back end vs full stack</h5>
      <p>
        Applications that require higher scalability and more complex workflows require broader skill
         sets and collaboration across teams. For example, the front end may be handled by the UI team, 
         and the back end by another team. In some organizations, individuals will be required to work on
         both the front-end and 
        back-end implementation of a feature. This is where full stack developers would come into play.

      <h5>Front-end developers ,   Back-end developers</h5>
      <p>
        These developers handle the UI of a web application (or website)—for example, visual effects, frames, navigation, and forms. 
        They focus mainly on user experience and use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as programming languages

        Back-end developers
        They deal with the business logic, security, performance, scalability, and handling request-response
        of the application. They create or use frameworks to 
       design the core application workflows and use technologies like JavaScript, Python, Java, and .NET.

      <h5>Full stack developers</h5>
      <p>
        They are responsible for coding end-to-end workflows by using both front-end 
        and back-end technologies. MERN stack and MEAN stack are examples of JavaScript-based technology 
        stacks that full stack developers can use to build end-to-end applications.
