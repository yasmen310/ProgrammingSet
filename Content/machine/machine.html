        Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses
        on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its
        accuracy.

        IBM has a rich history with machine learning. One of its own, Arthur Samuel, is credited for coining
        the term, “machine learning” with his research (link resides outside ibm.com) around the game of checkers.
        Robert Nealey, the self-proclaimed checkers master, played the game on an IBM 7094 computer in 1962, and he
        lost to the computer. Compared to what can be done today, this feat seems trivial,
        but it’s considered a major milestone in the field of artificial intelligence.

        Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning vs. Neural Networks
        Since deep learning and machine learning tend to be used interchangeably, it’s worth noting
        the nuances between the two. Machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks are all
        sub-fields of artificial intelligence. However, neural networks is actually
        a sub-field of machine learning, and deep learning is a sub-field of neural networks

      <h5>How machine learning works</h5>
      <p>
        UC Berkeley (link resides outside ibm.com) breaks out the learning system of a machine learning
        algorithm into three main parts.

        A Decision Process: In general, machine learning algorithms are used to make a prediction or classification.
        Based on some input data, which can be labeled or unlabeled, your algorithm will produce an estimate about
        a pattern in the data.
        An Error Function: An error function evaluates the prediction of the model. If there are known examples,
        an error function can make a comparison to assess the accuracy of the model.
        A Model Optimization Process: If the model can fit better to the data points in the training set,
        then weights are adjusted to reduce the discrepancy between the known example and the model estimate.
        The algorithm will repeat this “evaluate and optimize” process,
        updating weights autonomously until a threshold of accuracy has been met.

      <h5>Machine learning methods</h5>
      <p>
        Supervised machine learning
        Supervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, is defined by its use of
        labeled datasets to train algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. As
        input data is fed into the model, the model adjusts its weights until it has been fitted appropriately.
        This occurs as part of the cross validation process to ensure that the model avoids overfitting or
        underfitting. Supervised learning helps organizations solve a variety of real-world problems at scale,
        such as classifying spam in a separate folder from your inbox. Some methods used in supervised learning
        include neural networks, naïve bayes, linear regression,
        logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM).

    </div>
    <div class="NTIdes">
      <h5>Unsupervised machine learning</h5>
      <p>
        Unsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine
        learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. These algorithms discover
        hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention. This method’s
        ability to discover similarities and differences in information make it ideal for exploratory
        data analysis, cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation, and image and pattern recognition.
        It’s also used to reduce the number of features in a model through the process of dimensionality
        reduction. Principal component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD) are two common
        approaches for this. Other algorithms used in unsupervised learning
        include neural networks, k-means clustering, and probabilistic clustering methods.

    <div class="NTIdes">
      <h5>Semi-supervised learning </h5>
      <p>
        Semi-supervised learning offers a happy medium between supervised and unsupervised learning.
        During training, it uses a smaller labeled data set to guide classification and feature extraction
        from a larger, unlabeled data set. Semi-supervised learning can solve the problem of not having enough labeled
        data for a
        supervised learning algorithm. It also helps if it’s too costly to label enough data.
