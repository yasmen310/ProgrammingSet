      <p>A network consists of two or more computers that are linked in order to share resources (such as printers and
        CDs), exchange files, or allow electronic communications. The computers on a network may be linked through
        cables, telephone lines, radio waves, satellites, or infrared light beams.
        Two very common types of networks include:
        Local Area Network (LAN)
        Wide Area Network (WAN)
        You may also see references to a Metropolitan Area Networks (MAN), a Wireless LAN (WLAN), or a Wireless WAN
        (WWAN).

        Local Area Network
        A Local Area Network (LAN) is a network that is confined to a relatively small area. It is generally limited to
        a geographic area such as a writing lab, school, or building.
        Computers connected to a network are broadly categorized as servers or workstations. Servers are generally not
        used by humans directly, but rather run continuously to provide "services" to the other computers (and their
        human users) on the network. Services provided can include printing and faxing, software hosting, file storage
        and sharing, messaging, data storage and retrieval, complete access control (security) for the network's
        resources, and many others.
        Workstations are called such because they typically do have a human user which interacts with the network
        through them. Workstations were traditionally considered a desktop, consisting of a computer, keyboard, display,
        and mouse, or a laptop, with with integrated keyboard, display, and touchpad. With the advent of the tablet
        computer, and the touch screen devices such as iPad and iPhone, our definition of workstation is quickly
        evolving to include those devices, because of their ability to interact with the network and utilize network
        services.

      <p>
        Servers tend to be more powerful than workstations, although configurations are guided by needs. For example, a
        group of servers might be located in a secure area, away from humans, and only accessed through the network. In
        such cases, it would be common for the servers to operate without a dedicated display or keyboard. However, the
        size and speed of the server's processor(s), hard drive, and main memory might add dramatically to the cost of
        the system. On the other hand, a workstation might not need as much storage or working memory, but might require
        an expensive display to accommodate the needs of its user. Every computer on a network should be appropriately
        configured for its use.

        On a single LAN, computers and servers may be connected by cables or wirelessly. Wireless access to a wired
        network is made possible by wireless access points (WAPs). These WAP devices provide a bridge between computers
        and networks. A typical WAP might have the theoretical capacity to connect hundreds or even thousands of
        wireless users to a network, although practical capacity might be far less.

      <h5>Wide Area Network</h5>
      <p>
        Wide Area Networks (WANs) connect networks in larger geographic areas, such as Florida,
        the United States, or the world. Dedicated transoceanic cabling or satellite uplinks may be
        used to connect this type of global network.

        Using a WAN, schools in Florida can communicate with places like Tokyo in a matter of seconds,
        without paying enormous phone bills. Two users a half-world apart with workstations equipped with
        microphones and a webcams might teleconference in real time. A WAN is complicated. It uses multiplexers,
        bridges, and routers to connect local and metropolitan networks to global communications networks like the
        Internet.
        To users, however, a WAN will not appear to be much different than a LAN.

      <h5>Advantages of Installing a School Network</h5>
      <p>
        User access control.
        Modern networks almost always have one or more servers which allows centralized management for users and for
        network resources to which they have access. User credentials on a privately-owned and operated network may be
        as simple as a user name and password, but with ever-increasing attention to computing security issues, these
        servers are critical to ensuring that sensitive information is only available to authorized users.
        Information storing and sharing.
        Computers allow users to create and manipulate information. Information takes on a life of its own on a network.
        The network provides both a place to store the information and mechanisms to share that information with other
        network users.
        Connections.
        Administrators, instructors, and even students and guests can be connected using the campus network.

      <h5>Disadvantages of Installing a School Network</h5>
      <p>
        Expensive to Install.
        Large campus networks can carry hefty price tags. Cabling, network cards, routers, bridges, firewalls, wireless
        access points, and software can get expensive, and the installation would certainly require the services of
        technicians. But, with the ease of setup of home networks, a simple network with internet access can be setup
        for a small campus in an afternoon.
        Requires Administrative Time.
        Proper maintenance of a network requires considerable time and expertise. Many schools have installed a network,
        only to find that they did not budget for the necessary administrative support.
        Servers Fail.
        Although a network server is no more susceptible to failure than any other computer, when the files server "goes
        down" the entire network may come to a halt. Good network design practices say that critical network services
        (provided by servers) should be redundant on the network whenever possible.
